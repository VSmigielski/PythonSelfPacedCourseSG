    "\n",
    "Completing the activities here will allow you to demonstrate your ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Leverage `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions in Python to simplify the data processing techniques.\n",
    "-   Implement custom error handling for Python applications, including exception handling.\n",
    "-   Leverage a variety of concepts to implement advanced text analysis processes in Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each activity:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Use lambda, `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` functions as appropriate to solve these questions rather than traditional looping and conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You may apply any appropriate transformation on the data before applying lambda, `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You may use any Python data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Include appropriate exception handling for exceptions related to conversion errors or I/O errors."
