Any object has multiple functions or properties, some of which may be important in one scenario but may not be relevant in another scenario. For this reason, we often need to model objects for specific uses. For example, if we are modeling a building in a GPS mapping system, we would need to know location-specific data, such as its address and GPS coordinates. However, if we are creating a building for a 3-D landscaping system, its size and position within the lot would be more important.\n",
