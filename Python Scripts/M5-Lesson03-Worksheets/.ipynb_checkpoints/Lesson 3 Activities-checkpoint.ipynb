    "The activities in this page will demonstrate your ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define custom exception messages that will display when Python encounters an error in the code.\n",
    "* Use `try:except` to display a message based on the type of error Python encounters.\n",
    "* Use `try:except:finally` to continue running a script after Python has encountered an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the exercises on this page are based on activities completed in earlier modules. If you have the code for those activities, you are welcome to start with your existing code. However, you may find it useful to recreate those scripts here, as a review of the skills previously covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version of those activities, you are asked to implement exception handling using the tools presented in this lesson. For example, update the scripts to handle cases like the following:\n",

    "* Missing files\n",
    "* Division by zero\n",
    "* Conversion error \n",

    "For the file I/O activities, you are welcome to use any appropriate file, including files provided for other activities, files you download from a website, or files that you create for this activity.\n",
